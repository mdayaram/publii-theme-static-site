# Publii Static Site Theme

Version: 0.0.0.0

This theme was forked from the [Blank Theme](https://github.com/GetPublii/theme-Blank).

The Static Site theme aims to create a theme that makes it easier to navigate
Publii if your goal is to create a simple static site unrelated to blog posts.
A lot of Publii's features and options are blog post related, which makes it a
bit hard to navigate when all you want to do is create a handful of static pages
and just link them to each other.  This theme makes the above use case easier.

### Getting Started with Static Site Theme themesi

1. Download the blank.zip theme package
2. Open Publii and navigate to the Themes by clicking on the three dots in the top-right of the Publii interface to open the submenu, then clicking the Themes option
3. Drag and drop the downloaded blank.zip package onto the themes section; Publii will automatically unpack and add the downloaded theme to its library.
4. Now tha Blank theme will be available in the Site Settings on the drop-down list.
